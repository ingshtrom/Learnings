# John 13

## Summary This is the Passover meal in which a few major points happen:
1. Jesus washes his disciples feet
2. this is Jesus' last meal with his disciples
3. Jesus claims he will be betrayed and calls out Judas. I do not believe the actually calling out of Judas is recorded
   in any other gospel

## 12-20 Washing of Disciples Feet and Monologue The setting here is during the last Passover meal with Jesus and his 12
disciples.

> 12. When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned to his place. “Do you understand what
>     I have done for you?” he asked them.
* This is the setting and background for what is about to happen

> 13. “You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and rightly so, for that is what I am.
* Jesus is stating who he his is, again. He combines "Teacher" and "Lord" here, which I think is specific. I would go so
  far as to say that he is claiming his lordship over everything again, reminding his disciples just how powerful he is.
  In the same breath, in fact with just an additional word of "Teacher" he is also saying that he didn't come only to
  perform miracles or to make everyone his slave because he has the power to, or that he came here just to do fun stuff
  like healing people, splitting seas, "making" voices speak from the sky, etc. Jesus came to teach others what he stands
  for, his purpose on this earth. He came to teach others how they should be living. To show them how they are wrong to
  be living by the law and to provide an alternative to living by the law. **Remember, Jesus is stating his equality with
  God and his Lordship over everything in the universe.**

> 14. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should wash one another’s feet.
* Jesus restates who he is, says what he did physically and then uses that as a metaphor for how we should treat others.
  It's the golden rule that many of us are taught as children, no matter if we grew up in a Christian home or not--treat
  others as you would like to be treated... sort of. The point is that Jesus transitions from stating he is God and
  ruler of everything. That he is a teacher, and that this is how he expects followers of him to act. They are to act
  like him. We are called to act JUST LIKE THE GOD OF THE UNIVERSE! The cool thing, in my opinion, is that Jesus isn't
  just talking about it. He just blew these 12 peoples mind by washing their feet, which is what a servant might
  do--essentially a job deemed less worthy then themselves. Jesus lowered himself to the lowest level to teach us
  lessons.

> 15. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.
* yeah, you just taught us a lesson, we get it, John :wink:

> 16. Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent
>     him.
* :boom: I think this is the climax of this little monologue. We are all on the same playing field? We are all seen as
  the same, or equivalent, to the _creator of the universe_? Also, the idea of a slave being the same as the master...
  that is still controversial in some parts of the world (including countries in the West which think they are more
  "civilized" or maybe morally correct). The world, the people in the world, can create all sorts of pyramids of
  structure for people, but no matter what God permeates all of them. It just doesn't matter. This is why so much of the
  Jewish calendar revolves around these times when debts are released. Slaves are freed, debts are forgiven, property is
  given back to its original owners, etc. It's a complete reset, and that is what God wants. We've completely trashed
  the world that he has given us and in order to bring it back requires a reset of sorts. When that day comes, only the
  believer will survive the reset to be in Heaven.

> 17. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
* What I just said. God blesses the believer in Christ. The one who chooses to follow Jesus "until death do us apart".

> 18. “I am not referring to all of you; I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill this passage of Scripture:
>     ‘He who shared my bread has turned against me.’
* TODO

> 19. “I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe that I am who I am.
* TODO

> 20. Very truly I tell you, whoever accepts anyone I send accepts me; and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent
> me.”
* Again, showing how important we are to God. Jesus is an extension of God. We are an extension of Jesus. If someone
    believes what a true follower of Christ says, then it is as if they are listening to God. We are "made in God's
    image" after all!

## Learnings
1. Maybe it doesn't matter what we build here on earth, in terms of human structures that put people in groups or a
   hierarchy. It makes me think specifically of politics. We have all of this structure that puts certain people in more
   power than others, mostly based on their ability to spend lots and lots of money. Got doesn't care about that. I
   mean, if we are providing justice to his people on earth, I'm sure he is happy, but if it's just for the sake of
   "lording over others" or being able to push one's own agenda instead of for the justice of others and the speading of
   the good news of Jesus Christ, I really don't think God cares. Just LOVE people. We don't have to agree on
   everything. You don't need to read every piece of news and research the full background of everything before making a
   decision. Just live by the most important commandment to Love God and love your neighbor as yourself. And while we're
   here, `agape` them. Not this "I love you" and walk away. True empathy. Jesus weeped for the poor of spirit--we should
   be doing that. When someone is mean to them, we should feel the pain and sorrow that God feels for that person, not
   anger.
