* Jesus tries to calm down his 11 disciples
* He says he is preparing a place and the Disciples "know the way to the place where [he] is going", but then Thomas is
    confused because they don't know where Jesus is going, so how do they know the way? Jesus is referring to knowing
    the way to Heaven, which is to believe in him. That is it. He made that very clear and reiterated it in John 13,
    which sounds like it happened minutes before!
