## Word Studies

### "Among" or "In"

  It dawned on me while reading this that Jesus speaks about Christians being "among" or "in" him. It got me thinking that maybe he meant more than just being near him. Maybe it really means _in_ him, but at the same time maybe not.
  Clearly one cannot _physically_ be inside of another person. The physics of this world prevent that. But we can be in each other in spirit or in mindset. Something that I picked up from a video game that I played in my past talked about a species called the "hive". They were "space zombies," as described by the video game developers, but what was most interesting about them was that they were more or less dumb objects to be controlled remotely by some _manager_ or _overseer_. They never did anything for themselves, but rather always for the hive or what the _overseer_ wanted. Of course we see this somewhat in nature through bees in a colony, or through... <<< insert other example >>>... but with the Hive in this video game, they has a share consciousness. This is what God is wanting from us. He wants us to _share_ in his consciousness. So that we are of like mind with fellow Christians and working towards a similar goal. 

### Prune vs Take Away

In verse 2 it says...

> Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes that it may bear more fruit.
>

It seems pretty obvious at first glance that someone who is not in Jesus, he will take away, or destroy. To be clear, Jesus is just respecting their wishes to live their lives in eternal torture, but that is another topic entirely. Anyways... all is good until you see that Jesus wants to _prune_ those who _are_ in him...waaat?? So You want to cut me or take parts away from me as well? The more I thought about this and the more I researched a bit I found that this word choice seems very deliberate. To take something away is to remove it completely. To prune something is to remove the dead or unhealthy parts.  

My wife and I have been taking up gardening more seriously now that we have the space in our yard, but we realized after having a lot of plans and lots of sun and water that these plans _really_ like to flower. I mean there is a LOT of plant compared to the vegetable that it is bearing. Think about this--there are parts of the plant that are doing nothing but taking up energy just to sustain itself. It is taking nutrients from other parts of the plant just for itself, so it can do nothing except continue to be green and flower. That seems selfish to me! What do you do with these parts of the plant? You remove them! Notice the word choice. You are taking away the bad parts. If the whole plant is bad, then take it away. If only part of it is bad, you take that part away. We just so happy to have a word for taking only part of it away, and that word is pruning.
