# Intro

For our first child, we are potty training him at 22 months, almost on the dot.

Training](https://www.amazon.com/Crap-Potty-Training-Everything-Parenting/dp/1501122983).
Not only is is super useful, but she has a good sense fo humor as well, which

# Things I Have Learned

## Every Child is Different

Well, _of course_. Everyone says that, but it is
not until you are truly tested to your limits that you really understand
that, in my opinion. I think this dawned on me the most when we were potty
training our first born, who seemed to fully grasp potty training from day
one, we currently only on day two, but still refused to use the potty. He
threw a mini tantrum that lasted 5 seconds every time we even mentioned the
potty or said his name while around the potty chair. It was not until the
second night when I was watching him alone that I realized he just did not
want to sit down. My wife and I had suggested this, but it felt like no
matter what we said before he would not get near the potty, let alone use it.
Then I asked him, as if it was ritual to go to the potty prior to bath, to use
the potty standing up. He clearly understood, did a little pelvic thrust to get
closer to the potty (do not ask me why he did not just step forward) and peed.
It was as simple as that. We will see how the rest of the days go, but thus far
on the range of "I am clueless to I am peeing to I have peed to I need to pee",
he always was towards the end, but without the _want_ to actually use the potty.

In fact, funny enough, when we asked him where _pee pee_ went, he would say on
the floor, or on mommy, or on a toy train... literally anything that was in the
room except the potty. It felt like he was playing us!
