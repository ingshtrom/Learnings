# Intro

* it is not a one-size fit all
* it is really hard
* it frequently feels like I cannot do it without sacrificing too much

# Resources

* [IntelTechniques](https://inteltechniques.com/) -- especially the podcast. I
want to purchase the [Extreme Privacy](https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html) book as well.
* [SimpleLogin.io](https://simplelogin.io/) -- I think this has been the best
email forwarding and masking service I have found. The mobile app is great and
easy to use. I also use [BurnerMail](https://burnermail.io), but it doesn't have
a great mobile experience, which is nice for on-the-go generation of masked
emails.
* Reddit has a few communities that are great. 
  * [DeGoogle](https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/)
  * [Privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/)
  * [PrivacyToolsIO](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO)
* Miscellaneous websites
  * [RestorePrivacy](https://restoreprivacy.com/)
  * [PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io/) -- same as the subreddit with
      the name `r/privacytoolsIO` listed above
  * [ProPrivacy](https://proprivacy.com/) -- I need to research and see if it is
      as useful as others
